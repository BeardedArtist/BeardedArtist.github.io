# Background
```markdown
I'm currently an English Teacher in Fukuoka, Japan. 
When I'm not working, I am finishing up my computer science degree at Southern New Hampshire University. 
I've learned multiple programming languages and have created several different projects.
In my free time, I am creating my own video game in Unity and create websites.

When I have additional free time for myself, 
- I like to play video games, 
- travel abroad, 
- skateboard and 
- watch movies. 

I've traveled most of southeast Asia and want to continue traveling east to as many countries as I can.

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/BeardedArtist/BeardedArtist.github.io/edit/main/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.
